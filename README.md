# Interactive Frontend Development Project - Search Engine

Please find a demo of the website [here]()

I am a big fan of all types of films and so decided to use this project to try and create a search engine for all film fans out there who are looking for more information on their favourite film.

Users to this website will be able to type a film of their choice into the search engine and be provided with the title and poster attached to that film.

In addition to a specific film, the user is also provided with a selection of alternative film titles to browse through.

## UX
Users are introduced to the purpose behind the website through a

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery (3.4.1)
- Bootstrap (4.4.1)
- Bootswatch (4)

## Testing
I have completed tests on the website to confirm the 'About' button works as intended, that the input box collected the data typed in by the user and that the 'Find' button collected and stored the value of the data. 

Tests demonstrated...

I continuously used DevTools - found in Google Chrome - to test the page loads, layout, responsiveness, Javascript and CSS code.

## Deployment
The website has been published using Github Pages technology and you can find a version of this [here](https://liz94688.github.io/search-engine/.). The publishing has been done by using the Master Branch as the source.

## Credits
Content in the 'About' section was written by me.

**Media**
The photo used to alert a user when a 'poster_path' was unavailable was taken from Pexels, a stock image library.
