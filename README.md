## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- jQuery (3.4.1)
- Bootstrap (4.4.1)
- Bootswatch (4)

## Testing
I have completed tests on the website to confirm the 'About' button works as intended, that the input box collected the data typed in by the user and that the 'Find' button collected and stored the value of the data. 

Tests demonstrated...

I continuously used DevTools - found in Google Chrome - to test the page loads, layout, responsiveness, Javascript and CSS code.

## Deployment
The website has been published using Github Pages technology and you can find a version of this [here](). The publishing has been done by using the Master Branch as the source.

## Credits
Content in the 'About' section was written by me.

**Media**
The photo used to alert a user when a 'poster_path' was unavailable was taken from Pexels, a stock image library.
